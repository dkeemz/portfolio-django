      <p>Hey, I am Abdulhakeem Adamu, a full-stack web developer.</p>
      <p>
        Building simple, beautiful and interactive user experiences is where my
        passion lies. You can find my full projects list here.

        Interactivity is the lifeblood of a website. It's what keeps visitors
        engaged and coming back for more.

        Outside of programming, I enjoy playing chess and Farming and Learning
        new things. If you happen to be in the same city I live, maybe we can
        hang out and code together.
